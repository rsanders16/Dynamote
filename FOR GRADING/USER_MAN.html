 <h2>Dynamote Devices</h2>

        <img src = "img/19.jpg" height="500"/>
        <p>The list is empty.  Lets add a device:</p>
        <h3>Adding a Device</h3>
        <p>Dynamote needs the model number of the device so it can send the correct IR codes.  Enter the model number of the device you want to use.  If you add a device that Dyamote has detailed inforamtion on it will fill the rest of the form out for you.  See below, when one adds the Model # <b>CECHAxx</b>, the name and type form fields are auto filled</b></p>
        <img src = "img/20.jpg" height="500"/>
        <h3>Changing the Name of the device</h3>
        <p>Of course, if you do not like the name or type Dynamote pre-loads the form with, you can change it to your preference (see below)</p>

<h3>Hiding and Un-hiding A Device</h3>
        <p>All users can hide devices so that they do not show up on their remote, all while still not having to uninstall the device form Dynamote completely. See the demo below:</p>

        <p></p>
        <img src = "img/23.jpg" height="500"/>
